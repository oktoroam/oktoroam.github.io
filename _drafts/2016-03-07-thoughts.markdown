<p class="intro">
<b>Psalm 139:17-18 </b><br>
How precious to me are your thoughts, O God!<br>
How vast is the sum of them!<br>
If I would count them, they are more than the sand.<br>
I awake, and I am still with you. <br>
</p> 

The other day, as I was reading through Psalm 139, verses 17 and 18 really stood out to me. Being the great student that I am, I embarked on a journey to find out just how many grains of sand there are (rather than working on my homework).

According to [NPR](http://www.npr.org/sections/krulwich/2012/09/17/161096233/which-is-greater-the-number-of-sand-grains-on-earth-or-stars-in-the-sky), researchers at the University of Hawaii have estimated that there are (very roughly) 7.5*10<sup>18</sup> grains of sand on earth. Another way to write that number is **7.5 billion billion**. That's a lot of thoughts!

<p class="intro">
<b>Isaiah 55:8-9 </b><br>
For my thoughts are not your thoughts,<br>
neither are your ways my ways, declares the LORD.<br>
For as the heavens are higher than the earth,<br>
so are my ways higher than your ways<br>
and my thoughts than your thoughts.<br>
</p>

As I look towards the future I find myself trying to plan for every circumstance, running through multiple scenarios in my head, trying to discern the best course of action. Even as I'm overwhelmed by the possibilities and risks, vereses like these remind me that God has a plan infinitely more detailed than I can even imagine.
