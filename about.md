	I plan to share observations of things that stand out to me. My goal is to be fairly objective in sharing things from the text rather than my own opinions or interpretations. While for brevity I will often only share the particular verse that I found interesting I will strive to be accurate to the context of the verse, and would recommend reading the surrounding text as well.
